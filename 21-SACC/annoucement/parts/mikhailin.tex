One of the major open problems in theoretic computer science is showing the existence of a problem that
could be solved in polynomial time but not by a logarithmic depth circuit (so-called $\P$ vs
$\NC_1$). One approach that has a lot of progress in the last several years is to prove Karchmer, Raz,
and Wigderson conjecture. It states that there is no better way to compute the composition of two
functions than applying them one by one. Lately, several interesting weaker versions of this conjecture
were proven using the language of communication complexity. We will discuss this conjecture, its relation
to circuit lower bounds, recent advances and hopes to prove it in the future.
